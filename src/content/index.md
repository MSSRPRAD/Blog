#  **Welcome to my website!**


This is my personal website which I will try to maintain regularly. I will be posting some blog articles over the next few months here and share some parts of my work and life.

As for **why** to have a personal website, I have thought about it and :
1. It is good for your mental health to write frequently and you get to organize your thoughts more often.
2. It gives me an excuse to actually stop wasting time on mindless internet scrolling and actually do something productive instead.
3. It is too easy (and free!) to make and host one nowadays that there is no excuse to not have one.
4. Even if it amounts to nothing at least I have learnt something technical making the blog.
